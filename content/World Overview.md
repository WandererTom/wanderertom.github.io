The world of Aurelias is adorned with lands of mystery, filled with landscapes of wondrous beauty and resonant with echoes of ancient arcane energies and secrets long forgotten.

The sky is a swirling canvas of pinks, purples, blues, and oranges, refracting light borne from the slow dance of the world's two suns. Three moons shimmer in the aurora as they meander across the sky, visible both day and night.

In the distant past, many different kin were born unto this world, some believe placed by the gods themselves. Others believe they were derived from the entanglement of unseen magics that permeate the very fabric of the lands. However they came to be, over time the peoples spread across the lands and grew to great civilisations.
## Alethyria

Our story takes place on the continent of [[Alethyria]], a small and isolated group of lands surrounded by a deep and churning ocean. Found in the temperate northern hemisphere, it is home to many kin [[History of Alethyria|whose ancestors ventured across the seas in times past]]. Over time these early settlements evolved into several great civilisations.

On the easternmost part of the continent is [[Kingdom of Vadoria]], occupying the largest expanse of land and several surrounding islands to the north and east.

Carved into the treacherous mountains in the north known as the Jagged Peaks lies the dwarven nation of [[Dunren]].

On the mainland to the east is the [[Netherian Empire]], composed of the smaller nations of [[Virelleth]] to the north, [[Netheria]] in the centre, and [[Suthunam]] to the south.

Off the north-east coast lies a desolate volcanic island that is home to the [[Xendir]].

No nation occupies the southernmost part of the continent. Abandoned following the war of the Old Age, these [[Disputed Lands]] lie uninhabited and sealed to all.

For as long as memories have remained, the inhabitants of [[Alethyria]] have lived in ignorance of the world beyond their shores. Those who occupy the unexplored wider world have so far shown little concern for them, their continents separated by vast and dangerous oceans.

### Time & Seasons

Time in [[Alethyria]] is marked by the movement of the suns. The closest of these, the Nearsun, is the provider of warmth and illumination. For many it represents the essence of life and growth. Beyond this, the distant and diminutive Farsun is the bearer of a perpetual twilight and believed by many to be the domain of those who pass on after death.

Each day consists of 24 hours. A period of 300 days marks a Triad, named for its three distinct seasons.

The longest and most pleasant of these seasons is Luminar, bringing 200 long days of warmth and light. As the light progressively fades, Stomrund follows, and with it 50 days of swirling winds, lashing rains, and increasingly dark nights. As the Nearsun dissappears completely from the sky, the season of Bleak brings a relentless and biting cold, and a mere few hours of twilight from the Farsun for 50 days more.

As the cycle ends and repeats, a cascade of glorious light heralds the reemergence of the Nearsun and with it a warmth that rejuvenates the land and causes life to flourish once more.
#### Calandar & Key Events

The Alethyrians use a simple calendar that charts each triad's 300 days by its three seasons, starting at Luminar 1 and ending at Bleak 50.

In times long since forgotten, the lands of Alethyria were discovered by explorers from afar eager for new beginnings. Some settled in the lush green valleys and endless bounteous forests to the west, and thus began the [[Kingdom of Vadoria]]. To the east, others built their homes amongst the arid hills and temperate shoreline of the region that eventually became the [[Netherian Empire]].

A few soon became many, and as the two young nations evolved so did their desire for new lands and greater riches. Their borders crept further south, until they came upon a land of sublime beauty and wonder, overflowing with minerals and resonant with archaic arcane energy. Such was the adoration of the Vadorians, they named the land Asantia's Blessing, believing only the goddess of beauty and life could have forged its three majestic peaks with her own fair hands.

For a time both nations were blessed with the bounty of the land, sharing its abundance of beauty and resource in peaceful harmony. But gradually the resources waned and the land was spoiled. Friendship between the nations eroded and turned to bitterness and resentment. Desperate to cling onto what little remained, they became embroiled in a terrible and all consuming war. The beauty and energy of the now Disputed Lands became their curse.

For decades the bloody war raged on. Neither side gained ground nor relented. That was until, as legend has it, a powerful Netherian mage discovered an ancient artifact hidden deep within the [[Disputed Lands]]. It was imbued with an immense power, like nothing the Netherians had seen before. Blinded by a desire to finally eradicate their enemy from the lands, the Emperor entreated the mage to harness this power and use it to turn the tide of the war.

Reluctantly the mage agreed. From atop the central peak of the Disputed Lands, the mage attuned to the artefact and unleashed a terrible magic that surged outwards like a malevolent wave. It slaughtered thousands upon thousands of Vadorian soldiers and innocents, consuming the very fabric of their souls as it tore through them. But so great was this power that even the most adept of the mages was unable to contain it, and was overwhelmed in an immense explosion of light and unrelenting arcane energy. The burst of unleashed energy rent the very mountain asunder and washed far over the continent, laying waist to both Vadoria and Netheria alike. Those who survived referred from then on to this day as The Rending.

Surrounded by the ashes of their domains, the King and Emperor lamented the futility of their war. Horrified by the scale of destruction and loss of life, they humbled themselves and came together in the ruins of the once majestic mountain. It was here they defined the Pact of Ashes, and through this treaty put an end to the war, salvaged what remained of their people, and bound themselves to never seek out such malign power again. Both nations retreated from the Disputed Lands to leave it unclaimed and alone. After a time, they erected great walls aside each river border and sealed entry to the cursed land once and for all.
### The New Age

Determined to forget the terrible past, the King of Vadoria decreed to start anew and began the task of rebuilding his nation, embracing ideals of justice and learning. The King marked the beginning of the New Age, Triad 0. Over time memories of the Old Age faded, records were lost or destroyed, and life carried on.

Netheria too rebuilt, but such a new beginning proved challenging for the Elven Emperor. Cursed with his natural long life he became increasingly recluse, haunted by the shame of his destructive ambition and the lives it had claimed.

For a time the Emperor received envoys from Vadoria, carrying reassurances that The Pact held and preserving the distant bond between rulers. However, as one generation of Vadorian ruler succeeded to another, the visits became less frequent and sincere, viewed increasingly as a legacy of the Old Age. Eventually such visits were neither offered nor wanted, and the Emperor sealed access to Netheria for all. For a hundred Triads since, neither dignitary nor citizen has been granted passage in or out of the lands that form the Netherian Empire. News from the region has all but ceased.

Content in their own ways, the Kingdom of Vadoria grew to become a nation of peace and prosperity. The people live with an appreciation of life and an inherent gratitude for their nation's survival. Each generation has instilled this positive outlook into the next. The nation is tolerant and welcoming, and has become a beacon of personal freedoms balanced by the fair rule of law and order.

The human rulers of Vadoria strive to prove worthy of their people. Generation after generation of the Aurelwyn lineage passed, until on Triad 736 the current monarch, Queen Alira Aurelwyn, ascended to the throne. Kindly and fair, she enjoys the adoration and unwavering support of the populace. The Kingdom continues to prosper under her rule, active in the pursuit of technological and scientific discovery over military aims.

While the Vadorian military still exists, it is but a fraction of the force it once was. Comprised of the elite Queensguard in the capital and the Valeguard in the realm beyond, the soldiers maintain the peace, dispense justice, and protect the people from pirates or bandit groups that occasion the region and its surrounding islands.

For the Vadorians, the use of magic is closely guarded. While some harness it in various forms, most remain cautious and distrusting of those wielding such powers.

As for the great mage of Netheria, memories have eroded through the passage of time. Those who survived The Rending assumed the mage consumed by the terrible arcane power, and none mourned their passing.Â Occasionally, some who venture to The Edgelands tell of hearing the mage's whispers on the winds blowing softly from Asantia's Blessing.

A cataclysmic event caused by the [[The Great Mage of Netheria]] at the end of the [[Old Age]].

While intending to turn the tide of war in the favour of the [[Netherian Empire]], the mage inadvertently unleashed devastating arcane magic and decimated both the [[Kingdom of Vadoria]] and [[Netherian Empire]], and destroyed the central mountain in [[Asantia's Blessing]].

See [[History of Alethyria]].

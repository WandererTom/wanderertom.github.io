We begin our story in Triad 749 on a glorious day in the height of Luminar. We find ourselves in a place known as Valesview, a quaint little hamlet nestled on a hillside overlooking the majestic Vale of Songs. Standing grand amongst the small collection of homes is TBC Manor, home to respected High Lord TBC.

Today, the hamlet is a hive of activity. Guests arrive from near and far to attend the much anticipated union of the High Lord's firstborn son, the honorable Lord TBC and his betrothed, the sharp witted Lady Chastity Cheeseclothe.

High Lord TBC wanders around joyously greeting guests as they arrive and take their seats in the pristine gardens of the manor where the ceremony is to be held.

Light shimmers across the valley and the pristine towers of the City of Vadoria sparkle in the distance.

(Unknown to the players) Netheria is desolated. Dark magic overcame the land many years ago. The Emperor is a recluse. Undead and monsters are everywhere. Tyrant mage? Small group of soldiers, keen to rebuild empire's glory.
